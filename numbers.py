import math
# complex numbers = a + bi, integer = 1, float = 1.1

# complex number 

x = 1 + 2j

# when dividing to get the nearest whole number (10 // 3) = 3
# % = modulus will return leftover number from a division 
# ** = to the power of x

# augmented assignment operator

x = 10

x += 3
print(x) 
x -= 3
x -= 3
print(x)

# Helpful functions 

# round(2.9) = will round to the nearest whole number
# abs(-2.9) = absolute value = will return positive number
# Mass Module = import = has a lot of built in functions for math
